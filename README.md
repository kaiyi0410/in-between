# in-between
In-Between, Acey-Deucey, or Yablon is a casino type game played with 2 or more players. In-Between uses a standard 52 playing card deck. The objective of In-Between is to wager your bets on a card’s rank being in-between two previously drawn cards.

WHAT YOU NEED A deck of cards and money

STEP 1

Every player chips in the same sum of money to the pot. The pot becomes the maximum sum a person can bet each turn.

STEP 2

Deal two cards to the first player.

STEP 3

The player now has to decide if the next card will have a value that's in-between the two cards. An ace card has the smallest value (1) and a king has the largest (13). Suits don't matter. 

The player is allowed to bet as much as the total amount of money in the pot. If the value of the third card is in-between the first two cards, then the player may retrieve the amount s/he betted from the pot. If not, said amount will be added to the pot – making it grow bigger for the next player.

Be cautious before shouting “whole pot!” if you get dealt a lucky pair, like an ace and a king. If the third card happens to be the same as either of the first two dealt, then double of the said bet is added into the pot instead.

STEP 4

Once the player has taken from or added to the pot, the person on the left has a turn. The game carries on until the pot is completely depleted. The game can either end or every player can chip in again to begin a new round.
