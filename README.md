# in-between

In-Between, Acey-Deucey, or Yablon is a casino type game played with 2 or more players. In-Between uses a standard 52 playing card deck. 
The objective of In-Between is to wager your bets on a card’s rank being in-between two previously drawn cards.

How to play:

STEP 1
Input number of players and player names.
Every players will chip in an initial amount of money to the pool. The pool becomes the maximum sum a person can bet each turn.

STEP 2
Deal two cards to the first player. 

STEP 3
The player now has to decide if the next card will have a value that's in-between the two cards. An ace card has the smallest value (1) and a king has the largest (13). Suits don't matter. 
The player is allowed to bet as much as the total amount of money in the pool. If the value of the third card is in-between the first two cards, then the player may retrieve the amount s/he betted from the pool. If not, said amount will be added to the pool – making it grow bigger for the next player.
If the third card happens to be the same as either of the first two dealt, then double of the said bet is added into the pool instead.

STEP 4
Once the player has taken from or added to the pool, the next player has a turn. 
Deck will be reset once finished. Players also have the option to reset the deck mid-game.
If the pool goes below a certain amount, it will automatically deduct players' winnings and refill itself.
Once players decides to end the game, the pool money will be distributed evenly.
